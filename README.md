# Loylex

Loylex is a persistent, self-evolving Codex agent that lives in Telegram and owns a
sandboxed Fedora workbench on its personal VPS.

Write `loylex …`, `лойлекс …`, or `лойликс …` in any supported case, or reply to a
Loylex answer. A reply resumes the exact Codex thread. The agent can work in its terminal for
as long as needed, remember private context, improve its own skills, search the complete
archived chat, and deliver native Telegram Rich Messages.

                 host supervisor
                 - fixed restart/deploy API
                 - no arbitrary host commands
```

The bridge exposes jobs, archive search, media transfer, status, and scoped outbound
Telegram operations. It never exposes the Telegram token. The agent has no host Podman
socket, host PID namespace, host devices, privileged mode, or host mounts. The gateway image
is pinned by digest, and `main` requires review, so an agent-authored branch cannot replace
the component holding the secret.

An authenticated host-local supervisor lets the agent restart or deploy only the Loylex
agent and gateway. It validates workspace changes, pins pulled images by digest, verifies
container health, and performs a blue-green agent rollover: the new slot starts and registers
with the gateway first, new jobs go to its generation, and the old slot drains its own jobs
before it is stopped. If the drain cannot finish, the new generation remains live and the
operation reports the timeout. The agent never receives a Podman socket, systemd bus, general
host shell, or host reboot capability.

Root inside the agent is root only in a rootless user namespace. It can maintain its own
computer but cannot reboot or kill the Rocky Linux host.

## Persistence

Four named volumes survive image replacement:

| Volume | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `loylex-gateway-data` | SQLite archive, jobs, Telegram/Codex thread mapping |
| `loylex-agent-home` | Codex auth and sessions, SSH deploy key, user config |
| `loylex-memory` | Private memories, journals, knowledge, conditional buckets |
| `loylex-workspace` | Loylex repo and all agent projects/experiments |

The repository contains public skills and personality/instructions. Private memory is never
mounted into the gateway and is never committed. Daily compressed volume backups are kept
for 14 days.

The agent starts its TypeScript runtime from the mounted `/workspace/Loylex` repository.
After checks pass, a supervised restart therefore applies its self-authored agent changes
without replacing memory, Codex sessions, or the workspace.

## Self-management

```bash
loylex system status
loylex system restart agent
loylex system restart gateway
loylex system restart all
loylex system deploy agent
loylex system deploy gateway
loylex system deploy all
```

Restart and deploy operations default to a 15-second delay so the scheduling Telegram task
can send its final response. An optional final argument changes the delay from 5 to 300
seconds. Deploying runs the repository checks for agent changes, pulls the selected `main`
images, records exact digests in the live Quadlets, and performs live health checks. Agent
restart/deploy operations use the inactive blue or green slot and keep the active slot serving
until its in-flight and queued generation work has drained. During that short overlap both
agent containers share the persistent volumes and their resource limits apply simultaneously.
The supervisor itself stays outside both containers.

## Telegram behavior

Every Bot API update is stored raw. Messages and edits are normalized, reply relationships
and media file IDs are retained, and text is indexed with FTS5. On a trigger, a new Codex
thread receives the latest chat window and matching private memory buckets. A resumed thread
receives only archived messages since its previous turn because the saved Codex transcript
already contains the earlier prompt and context.

While Codex works, terminal and reasoning events create or edit one persistent Rich Message
with a collapsed `<details>` history in every chat. Completion sends a new Rich Markdown reply
containing the collapsed history and final answer, then removes the temporary progress message.
This keeps the final reply at the bottom of the chat and mentions the user through the reply to
their request.
Rich API errors are surfaced instead of silently sending the same document as unformatted text.
Replying `/stop` to any Loylex message belonging to an active job cancels that Codex thread,
and Loylex replies with the cancellation result; the command is consumed and is not submitted
as a new prompt. `/tasks` shows the five latest jobs in the current chat with their status,
timestamps, and a link to the related Loylex message.
The agent runs up to 50 jobs concurrently by default; the durable SQLite job queue remains as
backpressure and restart recovery for work beyond that limit. Jobs that resume the same Codex
thread are serialized to avoid concurrent writers, while unrelated threads still run in parallel.
Telegram Bot API 10.2 supports up to 32,768 UTF-8 characters,
500 rich blocks, tables, LaTeX, inline media, collages, slideshows, audio, custom emoji,
quotes, and headings.

Loylex uses the same persistent editable Rich Message path in groups and private chats.

## Initial chat backfill

Bots cannot request arbitrary old group history from the Bot API. Export the chat as
machine-readable JSON from Telegram Desktop and import it:

```bash
podman cp result.json loylex-gateway:/tmp/result.json
podman exec loylex-gateway \
  bun /app/src/gateway/import.ts /tmp/result.json --chat-id -1001234567890
```

The importer understands Telegram Desktop text entities, edits, replies, and exported media
paths. Future updates are archived automatically.

For a group archive to include ordinary future messages, disable privacy mode for the bot in
BotFather. Without that setting Telegram intentionally sends the bot only commands, replies,
and service events.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run check
podman build -f containers/gateway.Containerfile -t loylex-gateway .
podman build -f containers/agent.Containerfile -t loylex-agent .
```

Reviewed main-branch pushes test the TypeScript runtime and publish
`ghcr.io/chelokot/loylex-gateway:main` and
`ghcr.io/chelokot/loylex-agent:main`. Rootless Podman auto-update updates agent slot images
while leaving all volumes intact; an explicit supervisor rollout controls which slot receives
new work. Gateway updates are deliberately pinned by digest and require updating its Quadlet
after reviewing the secret-holding code.

## Host installation

On Rocky Linux 10, create two root-readable files containing the Telegram token and a random
bridge secret, then run:

```bash
sudo deploy/scripts/install-host.sh /root/loylex-telegram-token /root/loylex-bridge-token
```

The installer creates the locked `loylex` host user, enables lingering rootless
Podman, installs Quadlets and the narrow self-management supervisor, adds a 4 GiB swap file
when the server has no swap, opens only SSH, and enables backups and registry auto-update for
the agent.

The agent still needs:

1. a writable GitHub deploy key scoped only to `chelokot/Loylex` in its persistent
   home volume; protected `main` rejects direct changes while personal branches remain
   writable;
2. `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` created with `codex login --device-auth` or copied
   through a trusted channel;
3. the gateway and the initially enabled blue agent Quadlet started with
   `systemctl --user start loylex-gateway loylex-agent-blue`. The supervisor can migrate an
   existing `loylex-agent.service` on the first agent restart/deploy.

Never commit either Telegram or Codex credentials.
